Linda won the first prize with the help of the teacher.（对划线部分提问）<br>__________ Linda win the first prize?<br><br>【详解】句意：琳达在老师的帮助下获得了一等奖。划线部分“with the help of the teacher”是琳达获得一等奖的方式，疑问句应用how来提问。原句是一般过去时态，疑问句的助动词应用did。故填How did。<br>34. The students have performed the play—Sound of Music for years. （改为被动语态）<br>The play—Sound of Music _____________ performed by the students for years.<br><br>【详解】句意：多年来，学生们一直在表演音乐剧《音乐之声》。考查主动语态变被动语态。原句是现在完成时，应改为现在完成时的被动语态，其结构为have/has been done。主语“The play—Sound of Music”是第三人称单数，应该用has。故填has been。<br>35. It’s fun to go skating on real ice in winter.(改为感叹句)<br>_______ it is to go skating on real ice in winter!<br><br>【详解】句意：冬天在真正的冰上滑冰很有趣。分析句子可知，句子使用it固定句型：It’s+名词+to do，表示“做某事是……”，it是形式主语，真正的主语是后面的动词不定式；fun是名词，表示“趣事”，感叹的中心落在名词上，使用what引导符合语境，句式为：what +不可数名词+主语+谓语！故填What；fun。<br>36 David spent two hours and a half finishing his report on public health last night. （保持句意不变）<br>It _____ David two hours and a half to _____ his report on public heath last night.<br><br>【详解】句意：大卫昨晚花了两个半小时完成了他的公共卫生报告。原句中“sb spend time doing sth花费时间做某事”, 可以转换成“It takes sb some time to do sth做某事花费某人……时间”。原句中spent是动词spend的过去式，此处要用take的过去式took。故填took；finish。<br>37. We play a game to plant trees on Alipay in order to plant real trees and make our country beautiful. (保持句意不变)<br>We play a game to plant trees on Alipay ________ we can plant real trees and make our country beautiful.<br><br>【详解】句意：我们在支付宝上玩一个种树的游戏，为了种真正的树，让我们的国家变得美丽。分析原句可知，句子使用动词不定式结构“in order to do”表示目的；根据要求，在不改变句意的情况下，还可以转化为“so that”引导的目的状语从句。故填so that。<br>38. face masks, we, to protect ourselves, in public places, should wear （连词成句）<br>________________________________________________.<br><br>【详解】根据标点可知是陈述句。分析所给单词，we作主语，should wear作谓语，face masks作宾语，in public places作地点状语，to protect ourselves作目的状语。故答案为：We should wear face masks in public places to protect ourselves“我们应该在公共场所戴口罩来保护自己”。<br>九.

Her name is now widely known in Britain and even Europe. But that was not always the case.<br>Anning was a talented woman. She did not receive any proper education and taught herself geology（地质学）and paleontology（古生物学）.<br>Anning grew up by the sea. At a young age, she showed great interest in studying the fossils along the coastline. Anning worked very hard. She went out in all weathers to search for fossils. At the age of 12, she uncovered a skeleton（骨架）that looked like a crocodile（鳄鱼）. Then, after ten years of tireless effort, she made an amazing discovery. It was a huge fossil of something that the world had never seen before.<br>However, many of Anning’s findings disagreed with theories that had been widely accepted. What’s more, at that time, people had little respect for female scientists. Anning’s findings were even published without her name. During her lifetime, the woman was never seriously considered to be a scientist.<br>But such troubles didn’t stop Anning from making more discoveries. The woman was still keen on studying all sizes and types of fossils alongside the sea. Her discoveries helped to prove the existence of some extinct（已灭绝的）animals. They formed the basis for Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species（《物种起源》）.<br>In recent years, more and more people have come to realize the importance of Anning’s work. She is now listed among the top ten British women who have greatly affected the history of science. Anning was an ambitious and hard-working woman in history. She deserves to be remembered.<br>58. Mary Anning was a fossil scientist, wasn’t she?<br>_____________________________________________________<br>59. How did Mary Anning learn geology and paleontology?<br>____________________________________________________<br>60.

What did her discovery help to prove?<br>____________________________________________________<br>63. If you have a chance to interview Mary Anning, what question would you like to ask her most? Why?<br>____________________________________________________<br><br>【导语】本文主要讲述的是一名化石科学家玛丽•安宁。她在19世纪对她的研究领域做出了巨大贡献。<br>【58题详解】<br>根据第一段“As a fossil（化石）scientist, Mary Anning made great contributions（贡献）to her field in the 19th century.”可知，作为一名化石科学家，玛丽•安宁在19世纪对她的研究领域做出了巨大贡献。所以该反意疑问句应为肯定回答。故填Yes, she was.<br>【59题详解】<br>根据第二段“She did not receive any proper education and taught herself geology（地质学）and paleontology（古生物学）.”可知，她没有接受过任何正规的教育，只能自学地质学和古生物学。可见，玛丽自学地质学和古生物学。故填She taught herself.<br>【60题详解】<br>根据第三段“At the age of 12, she uncovered a skeleton（骨架）that looked like a crocodile（鳄鱼）.”可知，12岁时，她发现了一具看起来像鳄鱼的骨架。可见，玛丽12岁的时候，发现了一具看起来像鳄鱼的骨架。故填She uncovered a skeleton that looked like a crocodile.<br>【61题详解】<br>根据第三段“Then, after ten years of tireless effort, she made an amazing discovery. It was a huge fossil of something that the world had never seen before.”可知，后来，经过十年的不懈努力，她有了惊人的发现。这是一块巨大的化石，是世界上从未见过的。可见，玛丽22岁的时候，发现一个巨大的化石。故填At the age of 22.<br>【62题详解】<br>根据第五段“Her discoveries helped to prove the existence of some extinct（已灭绝的）animals.”可知，她的发现有助于证明一些灭绝动物的存在。故填The existence of some extinct animals.<br>【63题详解】<br>如果有机会采访玛丽•安宁，我会问她：什么让你如此有抱负？因为我觉得她非常有抱负，我想了解她真正的想法。故填What made you ambitious? Because she was ambitious, I want to know her real idea.<br>十三、 Writing（作文）（本大题共1题, 共20分）<br>64.

        "info": "<br>【导语】本文主要介绍了日本一名动物火车站站长——猫咪Tama。<br>【51题详解】<br>句意：一种新型的火车站站长已经在日本出现：动物火车站站长。根据“Many stations stopped employing(雇用) stationmasters a long time ago.”可知许多车站很久以前就停止雇用站长，根据however可知表示转折，结合首字母，应用appear表示“出现”，句子是现在完成时，应用过去分词。故填(a)ppeared。<br>【52题详解】<br>句意：Kishi车站周边地区没有任何游客。根据“The trains were often empty. ”可知火车经常空无一人，结合首字母，应用visitor表示“游客”，any后接可数名词复数。故填(v)isitors。<br>【53题详解】<br>句意：他决定将Tama介绍给铁路线的经理担任站长。短语introduce sb to sb表示“将……介绍给……”，符合题意，to后接动词原形。故填(i)ntroduce。<br>【54题详解】<br>句意：相反，他们会给她免费的食物。根据“Tama’s bosses did not have to give her any money as salaries…., they gave her free food. ”可知Tama的老板不必给她任何钱作为工资……他们给了她免费的食物，前后为转折，结合首字母英语instead表示“相反”。故填(I)nstead。<br>【55题详解】<br>句意：毕竟，站长在任何时候都必须在客户面前显得精神。根据“She needed to greet customers and wear a stationmaster’s hat and a uniform. ”可知她需要迎接顾客，所以戴上站长的帽子并且穿上制服，让自己看起来更加精神、帅气，smart表示“衣着讲究的”。故填(s)mart。<br>【56题详解】<br>句意：Tama不仅为车站带来了生意，还为当地经济带来了数十亿日元。根据“brought a few billion yen(日元) to the local…”可知为当地……带来上十亿日元，结合首字母英语economy表示“经济”。故填(e)conomy。<br>【57题详解】<br>句意：她葬礼有许多粉丝参加，他们最后一次悲伤地告别了这位超级站长。句子是非限制性定语从句，从句需用副词修饰动词said，因为是葬礼，结合首字母应用sadly表示“悲伤地”。故填(s)adly。<br>D. Answer the questions（根据短文内容回答下列问题）（12分）<br>Jimmy and Li Lei are listening to Mr. Peterson, their P.E. teacher, tell them that they are going to play dodge ball in class. Li Lei, concerned(担心的) she will look silly because she does not know how to play it, looks for help. Jimmy sees her worried look, so he asks, “Li Lei, What’s wrong?”<br><br>Li Lei answers, “In China, we play dodge ball, but I think it’s different from the American style, so I don’t know how to play it in the American way.”<br>Jimmy is eager to help Li Lei, an exchange student at his school. He says, “It’s not too hard. First, there are five balls. Mr. Peterson puts all of the balls in the middle of the court. The two teams stand at different ends of the court. Then, Mr. Peterson blows his whistle(哨子) to start the game. When you hear the whistle, run and try to take one of the balls. Then, throw the ball at the members of the opposite team.”<br>Li Lei asks, “What about catching the ball? If I catch the ball, am I out?”<br>“Actually, if you catch the ball, then the person who threw the ball is out. Also, one member from your own team can come back and play when you catch the ball.”<br>Li Lei is still worried. “There are so many balls. I’m afraid I won’t see one thrown at me. What if a ball hits me on the head and breaks my glasses?”<br>Jimmy says, “People aren’t supposed to throw at your head. If someone hits you on the head, then that person is out. Also, the balls are soft, so they won’t hurt you. But be careful. Sometimes, one player distracts(使……分心) you while another player tries to hit you. Lastly, when time is up, Mr. Peterson will count the members left in each team. If         , the other team wins.”<br>With the help of Jimmy, Li Lei doesn’t feel worried any more and says, “This sounds fun. I can’t wait to play.”<br>58. Li Lei is an exchange student in an American school, isn’t she?<br>_________________________________________<br>59. Why is Li Lei concerned when she learns she is going to play dodge ball?<br>_________________________________________<br>60.

Also, one member from your own team can come back and play when you catch the ball.”可知实际上，如果你接住球，那么扔球的人就出局了。此外，当你接球时，您自己团队中的一名成员可以回来玩。故填The person who threw the ball is out and one member from your own team can come back and play.<br>【62题详解】<br>根据倒数第二段“Sometimes, one player distracts(使……分心) you while another player tries to hit you. ”可知有时，一个玩家会分散你的注意力，而另一个玩家试图打你。故填Because another player tries to hit you.<br>【63题详解】<br>本题是开放性回答，须符合题意。根据倒数第二段“Mr. Peterson will count the members left in each team. If              , the other team wins.”可知彼得森先生将计算每个团队中剩余的成员。如果……，另一支球队获胜。由前文可知，接到球的话，扔球的人出局，因此赢得队伍人数最多，相反，输的队伍人数较少。故填one team has fewer members.<br>Ⅶ. Writing（作文）（本大题共1题，共20分）<br>64.

He plays the drums, bass, guitar, and piano.<br>Seba grew up with music all around. Before he turned three, his parents asked him what he wanted for his birthday. “Drums!” he answered. His parents weren’t sure, but after seeing him play the drums at a local music store, they decided he was serious. They bought him a junior drum kit (成套的架子鼓). “He didn’t stop playing—ever,” says his dad.<br>But two months later, Seba grew upset. He couldn’t make the sounds he wanted with his junior drum kit. His parents bought him a professional drum kit and signed him up for lessons. In just a few months, his drum teacher reported that Seba was learning extremely quickly and needed a higher level of training. He was still four.<br>Seba started a band in kindergarten. In the first grade, he began earning money by playing music.<br>In 2020, Seba joined a summer music program at Berklee College of Music (伯克利音乐学院) as an 8-year-old boy. He studied bass in an online program.

        "info": "<br>【导语】本文主要讲述了刘伟学放弃了一份高薪的设计师工作，向祖父学习余杭油纸伞的制作工艺的故事。<br>【51题详解】<br>句意：2015年，刘伟学放弃了一份高薪的设计师工作，向祖父学习余杭油纸伞的制作工艺。根据首字母提示和“… the a …of making Yuhang oil paper umbrellas.”可知是，余杭油纸伞的制作工艺，art“艺术，美术，技艺”符合题意，故填(a)rt。<br>【52题详解】<br>句意：制作伞骨和糊纸是其中的两项重要技能。根据首字母提示和“There are more than 70 steps to make a Yuhang oil paper umbrella. Making bamboo ribs(伞骨) and pasting (糊) papers are two…skills among them.”可知，制作余杭纸伞的70多道工艺中，制作伞骨和糊纸是两项重要技能，空格处修饰名词skills，作定语，用形容词，important“重要的，形容词”符合题意，故填(i)mportant。<br>【53题详解】<br>句意：刘改进了雨伞以赢得年轻人的心。根据首字母提示和“…he used a thicker paper… As young people like hand-painted pictures, he invites painters to draw patterns on the umbrella covers.”可知，刘改进了雨伞，improve“改进，改善”符合题意，此句表达过去的事情，应用一般过去时，故填(i)mproved。<br>【54题详解】<br>句意：由于纸很容易碎，他用了一种更厚的纸。根据“he used a thicker paper. In a test, his umbrellas were opened and closed 1,000 times without breaking.”可知，纸很容易碎，空格处修饰动词“broke”，应用副词，easily“容易地，副词”符合题意，故填(e)asily。<br>55题详解】<br>句意：他用一种更轻的竹子做伞骨，所以雨伞的重量更小。根据首字母提示和“so the umbrellas weigh less”可知，使用了一种更轻的竹子，空格处作定语，修饰名词kind，且是与原先竹子进行比较，用形容词比较级，lighter“更轻的”符合题意。故填(l)ighter。<br>【56题详解】<br>句意：尽管如此，他并不着急。根据“It now has more than 80,000 followers…he doesn’t hurry. To ensure quality, his studio makes only 1,000 umbrellas each year.”可知，前后句是转折关系，still“然而，尽管如此”符合题意，句首首字母要大写，故填(S)till。<br>【57题详解】<br>句意：他希望自己能进入当地的学校，教学生他所知道的关于如何制作这种雨伞的一切。根据首字母提示和“teach students…he knows on how to make this kind of umbrellas”可知是，教学生他所知道的关于如何制作这种雨伞的一切，everything“所有事物，一切”符合题意。故填(e)verything。<br>D. Read and answer the questions（阅读短文，根据以下内容回答问题）（12分）<br>Last month, the Grade Nine students in Garden School had a debate(辩论) on the topic “Is it a good idea for parents to talk about the family finances(家庭财政) with their kids?”. Here are some opinions from Lisa, one of the students who thinks it is a good idea.<br><br>Most parents believe it is not proper to tell their kids about how much they make and how much they spend, so most families don’t talk about money with their kids. They basically feel it is not their concern. You could easily agree. But is it really none of our business? Doesn’t our parents’ income(收入) affect us? They use the money to pay for food, clothing and shelter. If they lost their jobs and became unemployed, wouldn’t that affect us, too?<br>I’m not going to say parents should show their kids every bill before paying it or that they should ask their kids for advice on big financial decisions, but I will say they should keep kids involved and informed. It is part of teaching them about money and life. Kids follow their parents’ every move and learn from them.<br>Parents have to teach their kids about money because kids don’t learn it in school. As a parent, it’s necessary to teach them about saving, investing and staying away from credit(赊欠). Also, parents have to manage their own money well if they really want to set an example.<br>So I think it’s a good idea for parents to talk about the family finances with their kids. Tell them how much your salary is. It might help them decide which career to choose. Tell them how you spend your own money and talk to them before you make big purchases such as a new car. Include them in the process so that they know how it works and are satisfied with it. You can include them more and more as they get older. Don’t make money a taboo(禁忌) issue in your home.<br>58. Most families talk about money with their kids, don’t they?<br>________________________________________________.<br>59. When did the Grade Nine students in Garden School have a debate?<br>_____________________________________________________________.<br>60. According to Lisa, what do parents use money to do?<br>_____________________________________________________________.<br>61. Why do parents have to teach their kids about money?<br>_____________________________________________________________.<br>62. What does Lisa mean by saying “Is it really none of our business”?<br>_____________________________________________________________.<br>63. Do you want your parents to talk about family finances with you? Why or why not? Please give at least two reasons.<br>_____________________________________________________________.<br><br>【导语】本文主要通过Lisa的观点来表示父母应该和孩子谈论家里的财政。<br>【58题详解】<br>根据“so most families don’t talk about money with their kids.”可知，大多数家庭不会和孩子谈钱。因此作否定回答。故填No, they don’t.<br>【59题详解】<br>根据“Last month, the Grade Nine students in Garden School had a debate(辩论) on the topic ‘Is it a good idea for parents to talk about the family finances(家庭财政) with their kids?’.”可知，是上个月举行的辩论。故填Last month.<br>【60题详解】<br>根据“They use the money to pay for food, clothing and shelter.”可知，他们用这些钱来支付食物、衣服和住所。故填Parents/They use money to pay for food, clothing and shelter.<br>【61题详解】<br>根据“Parents have to teach their kids about money because kids don’t learn it in school.”可知，因为孩子们在学校里学不到关于金钱的知识，所以父母必须教他们。故填Because kids don’t learn it in school.<br>【62题详解】<br>根据“Doesn’t our parents’ income(收入) affect us? They use the money to pay for food, clothing and shelter. If they lost their jobs and became unemployed, wouldn’t that affect us, too?”可知，Lisa的意思是家里的财政与我们有关系。故填Linda/She means it is some of our business./Linda/She means the family finances have something to do with kids.<br>【63题详解】<br>开放性试题，言之有理即可，参考答案为：Yes, I do. Because it can help me decide which career to choose and it is part of teaching me about money and life.<br>",

He started thinking about the effect plastic pollution has on the environment, especially on rivers and oceans. That’s when he got interested in environmental issues.<br>Cash, now 12, found that rivers are at the heart of the problem. A report in Science Advances said that far more rivers are carrying large amounts of plastic into our oceans than was once thought. This news hit close to home for Cash. He lives in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The city sits on the Tennessee River. It’s one of the most polluted rivers in the world. This information led Cash to take action. He made it his mission to clear garbage from public spaces and waterways.<br>At first, Cash and his parents worked to pick up garbage near the Tennessee River. But soon he realized he would need more help. So he organized community cleanup outings. Eventually, he and other volunteers removed more than 11,000 pounds of garbage from the river. Cash has also partnered with businesses to recycle plastic bottles and cans. He has recycled more than 2,000 pounds of them. The money he earned from that supported river protection efforts. Cash loves sea animals. By cleaning waterways, he helps protect these creatures.<br>He also set up fishing-line recycling containers(容器) along the Tennessee River. People can throw away their fishing line in these instead of in the water, where it entangles(缠住) wildlife.<br>Cash enjoys getting other kids involved in these activities. He wrote a children’s book called One Small Piece. It’s about pollution in waterways and oceans. Cash also co-founded the Cleanup Kids. The group encourages children not to throw away anything that can be recycled. “Kids may be small percentage of the population,” Cash says, “but they are 100% of the future.”<br>58. Cash got interested in environmental issues when he was 9, didn’t he?<br>______________________________<br>59. What did Cash decide to do when he knew about the Tennessee River?<br>______________________________<br>60. Who did Cash work with at first when picking up garbage near the Tennessee River?<br>______________________________<br>61. What does the underlined word “that” in the third paragraph refer to?<br>It refers to “______________________________”.<br>62. Why did Cash set up fishing-line recycling containers along the Tennessee River?<br>______________________________<br>63. What is the implied(隐含的) meaning of the underlined sentence in the last paragraph?<br>______________________________<br><br>【导语】本文主要介绍了现在12岁的Cash对环境保护感兴趣，介绍了他做的一系列保护环境的事情。<br>【58题详解】<br>根据“Three years ago…That’s when he got interested in environmental issues.”及“Cash, now 12”可知，现在是12岁，三年前对环境问题感兴趣，也就是在9岁的时候感兴趣，故填Yes, he did.<br>【59题详解】<br>根据“He made it his mission to clear garbage from public spaces and waterways”可知，决定以清理公共场所和水道中的垃圾为己任，故填He decided to clear garbage from public spaces and waterways.<br>【60题详解】<br>根据“At first, Cash and his parents worked to pick up garbage near the Tennessee River.”可知，起初和他的父母在田纳西河附近捡垃圾，故填He worked with his parents.<br>【61题详解】<br>根据“Cash has also partnered with businesses to recycle plastic bottles and cans. He has recycled more than 2,000 pounds of them. The money he earned from that supported river protection efforts”可知，把与企业合作回收塑料瓶和易拉罐挣来的钱用来支持河流保护工作，所以that指代recycle plastic bottles and cans，故填recycle plastic bottles and cans。<br>【62题详解】<br>根据“People can throw away their fishing line in these instead of in the water, where it entangles(缠住) wildlife”可知，人们可以把鱼线扔在这些地方，而不是扔在水里，那样会缠住野生动物，故填Because people can throw away their fishing line in these instead of in the water, where it entangles wildlife.<br>【63题详解】<br>根据“The group encourages children not to throw away anything that can be recycled”及“‘Kids may be small percentage of the population,’ Cash says, ‘but they are 100% of the future.’”可知，鼓励孩子们要保护环境，故填It encourages children to protect the environment.<br>Ⅶ.

(共12分)<br>Read the passage and answer the following questions. (根据短文内容回答下列问题)<br>For skydivers, the sky isn’t the limit. It’s just the beginning. Thousands of people try skydiving each year. Some only jump once, while others go on to experience lifelong adventures, flying and turning over through the air.<br>Skydiving is a method of leaving an airplane and returning to the earth with the help of gravity (重力), then slowing down by using a parachute (降落伞). It may include more or less free-fall, a time during which the parachute has not been used and the body gradually accelerates (加速) to the highest speed.<br>There are three choices for the beginners. However, before you try skydiving, a ground course on safety is required. The first method is accelerated free-fall. You jump out of the plane while being held by two coaches, one on either side. They hold onto you until you open your parachute. The second method is called static line. After jumping out, you will experience free-fall for a second or two. Then the weight of your body will pull the line tight, opening the parachute. Tandem (串联) is the most popular because it is the easiest. You and the coach are tied together, the coach behind, with you in front. You jump out of the plane together, and the coach takes care of opening the parachute.<br>For each of these three methods, the coaches give instructions in the air with hand signals or a radio. If you want to try something challenging and would love to feel the freedom of flying, skydiving might be an adventure for you. Who knows? With risk and excitement mixed together, skydiving might just change your life.<br>58. Do thousands of people try skydiving each year, don’t they?<br>________________________________<br>59. For the beginners, how many methods can they choose?<br>________________________________<br>60. Why do most of the beginners choose tandem?<br>________________________________<br>61.
